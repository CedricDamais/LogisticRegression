# LogisticRegression
In this personal project I was able to create a logistic regression from scratch to make predictions on the load_breast_cancer dataset.
The relevant features I used were 'worst concave points', 'worst perimeter', 'worst radius'. 

I was able to learn the math behind a linear regression. I implemented a solution that is on par with the one from sklearn in terms of accuracy on the on the load_breast_cancer dataset. I Studied two kinds of cost function â€” Mean Squared Error and Log Loss. These concepts give you the freedom to combine different tools for solving complex problems.
