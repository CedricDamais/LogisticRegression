# LogisticRegression
Hello, in this project I coded a logistic regression from scratch

I Learned the math behind it and implemented a solution that is on par with the one from sklearn in terms of accuracy. I Studied two kinds of cost function â€” Mean Squared Error and Log Loss. These concepts give you the freedom to combine different tools for solving complex problems.
